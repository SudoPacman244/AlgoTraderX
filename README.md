Complete Step-by-Step Trading Bot Setup Guide for Absolute Beginners

Welcome! This guide will walk you through every single step to set up, run, and monitor a Python trading bot—even if you have zero experience with programming or computers. I’ll also show you how to use ChatGPT (an AI helper) to make improvements and ask questions, just like you’re doing now. Imagine having a virtual assistant who can guide you through programming, troubleshooting, and adjusting your bot to work just right for you.

By the end of this guide, even if you’re new to computers, you’ll be able to follow each step to get your bot running.

Step 1: Install Required Software

1.1 Install Anaconda (Python Environment)

Anaconda is a program that helps you install Python (the programming language we’re using) and all the tools the bot needs to run. Think of Anaconda as your “workbench” for building and running the bot.

	1.	Download Anaconda:
	•	Open a web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and go to the Anaconda Download Page.
	•	Choose the correct installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
	•	Click the download button to save the installer to your computer.
	2.	Install Anaconda:
	•	Windows: Find the downloaded installer file in your “Downloads” folder. Double-click it to start the installation.
	•	Follow the prompts. If it asks to “Add Anaconda to PATH,” make sure to check the box (this will make it easier to use Anaconda later).
	•	Click Install to complete the installation.
	•	macOS: Open the downloaded file. Drag the Anaconda icon to the Applications folder.
	•	Linux: Open a terminal (a command-line interface that lets you type commands) and navigate to the downloaded file’s location. Run this command (replace <filename> with the actual name of your file):

bash <filename>.sh


	3.	Verify Installation:
	•	Open the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
	•	Type:

conda --version


	•	Press Enter. If a version number appears, Anaconda is installed and ready to use.

1.2 Install Visual Studio Code (Text Editor for Python)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a program where you’ll write, edit, and run the bot code. Think of it as the “workbench” where you’ll put the bot together and make adjustments.

	1.	Download VS Code:
	•	Open your web browser and go to the Visual Studio Code Download Page.
	•	Download the installer for your operating system.
	2.	Install VS Code:
	•	Windows: Double-click the installer and follow the steps to install.
	•	macOS: Open the downloaded file, then drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the Applications folder.
	•	Linux: Follow the specific instructions for your Linux version on the Visual Studio Code download page.

1.3 Install Python Extensions in VS Code

Once VS Code is installed, you need to add a Python “extension,” which lets VS Code understand and run Python code.

	1.	Open VS Code.
	2.	Install the Python Extension:
	•	On the left sidebar, click the Extensions icon (four squares).
	•	In the search bar at the top, type “Python” and press Enter.
	•	Find the Python extension by Microsoft and click Install.

Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment in Anaconda

Anaconda allows you to create a “Python environment,” which is a workspace where you install all the tools and libraries your bot needs.

	1.	Open Anaconda Prompt:
	•	Windows: Click Start, type “Anaconda Prompt,” and open it.
	•	macOS/Linux: Open your Terminal.
	2.	Create a Virtual Environment:
	•	In the Anaconda Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:

conda create -n trading_bot python=3.9


	•	This creates an environment named trading_bot with Python version 3.9. Environments keep all the tools you need in one place, separate from other projects on your computer.

	3.	Activate the Environment:
	•	To start using this environment, type:

conda activate trading_bot


	•	Now, everything you install will go into this trading_bot environment. You should see (trading_bot) at the start of the line in Anaconda Prompt, showing it’s active.

	4.	Install Required Libraries:
	•	With your environment activated, type:

pip install requests pandas talib twilio openai


	•	Explanation:
	•	requests: Lets the bot access the internet to get data.
	•	pandas: Helps the bot organize and manage data.
	•	talib: Provides tools for financial calculations.
	•	twilio: Allows the bot to send SMS notifications.
	•	openai: Connects the bot to ChatGPT for intelligent responses.

Step 3: Set Up API Keys

API keys are like passwords that allow your bot to connect to various services securely. Here’s how to get and use each one.

3.1 Set Up an Alpaca Account (for Brokerage and Market Data)

	1.	Sign Up: Go to Alpaca and create an account.
	2.	Choose the Algo Trader Plus Subscription ($100/month): This is essential for real-time market data.
	•	Why: Real-time data ensures the bot makes accurate trading decisions, and increased rate limits allow it to retrieve data more frequently.
	3.	Get Your API Keys:
	•	In your Alpaca account, go to API Settings and copy your API Key and Secret Key.

3.2 Set Up a Polygon Account (for Historical Data)

	1.	Sign Up: Go to Polygon.io and create an account.
	2.	Get Your API Key: Copy your API Key from the dashboard.

3.3 Set Up an OpenAI Account (for ChatGPT-4 Analysis)

	1.	Sign Up: Go to OpenAI and create an account.
	2.	Get Your API Key: Copy your API Key from the dashboard.

3.4 Set Up a Twilio Account (for SMS Alerts)

	1.	Sign Up: Go to Twilio and create an account.
	2.	Get Your API Credentials: Copy your Account SID and Auth Token.

Step 4: Open and Edit the Script in Visual Studio Code

	1.	Open VS Code.
	2.	Open the Script File:
	•	Click File > Open File and select your Python script file.
	3.	Insert Your API Keys:
	•	Replace placeholders in the script with your API keys:

ALPACA_API_KEY = 'your_alpaca_api_key'
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = 'your_alpaca_secret_key'
POLYGON_API_KEY = 'your_polygon_api_key'
CHATGPT_API_KEY = 'your_chatgpt_api_key'
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_twilio_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'


	4.	Save the File:
	•	Press Ctrl + S (Windows) or Cmd + S (macOS) to save.

Step 5: Changing the Python Interpreter in VS Code (If Needed)

	1.	Open the Command Palette:
	•	Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + P (macOS).
	2.	Select “Python: Select Interpreter”:
	•	Type “Python: Select Interpreter” and select it.
	3.	Choose Your Environment:
	•	Find and select the trading_bot environment.

Step 6: Running the Trading Bot

	1.	Open Anaconda Prompt and activate your environment:

conda activate trading_bot


	2.	Navigate to the Script’s Folder:
	•	Use cd to move to your bot’s folder:

cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\TradingBot


	3.	Run the Script:

python your_script_name.py

	•	The bot will start running, retrieving data, and making trading decisions.

Step 7: Monitoring the Bot’s Performance

	•	Check Logs: View logs in the terminal to see what the bot is doing.
	•	SMS Notifications: Twilio will send you updates if configured correctly.

Step 8: Using ChatGPT to Improve and Troubleshoot

ChatGPT is like a digital assistant who can help you understand, troubleshoot, and even improve your bot.

How to Use ChatGPT

	1.	Ask for Help: If something doesn’t work, ask ChatGPT to explain or troubleshoot the issue. For example:
	•	“Why am I getting this error: ModuleNotFoundError?”
	•	“How can I add a new feature to buy and sell based on a moving average?”
	2.	Ask for Code Examples: ChatGPT can give you examples for almost anything:
	•	“How can I add a stop-loss feature?”
	•	“Show me how to log more details in my trading bot.”
	3.	Experiment with Adjustments:
	•	Try asking ChatGPT to suggest ways to adjust settings or add functionality to the bot to make it better fit your needs.
