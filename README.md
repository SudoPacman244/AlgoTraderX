AlgoTraderX: Adaptive Algorithmic Trading Bot

AlgoTraderX is a Python-based algorithmic trading bot designed for the stock and options market. This bot leverages multiple APIs to execute trades based on technical indicators, includes adaptive risk management, and provides real-time notifications.

Features

	•	Technical Indicator-Driven: Uses indicators like SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and ATR.
	•	Risk Management: Includes dynamic position sizing and stop-loss/take-profit.
	•	Market Regime Detection: Adjusts strategies based on trending or ranging conditions.
	•	Error Handling & Alerts: Sends SMS notifications and logs performance data.

1. Prerequisites and Downloads

To use this project, you’ll need to install several tools and services.

Python 3.8 or Higher

	1.	Download Python.
	2.	Follow the installation instructions.
	3.	Important: When installing, make sure to select Add Python to PATH.

Anaconda (Optional but Recommended)

Anaconda helps manage environments and dependencies, simplifying Python setup.

	•	Download Anaconda.
	•	Install and open the Anaconda Navigator to manage environments.

Code Editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

A code editor is needed to work with and modify the script.

	•	Download Visual Studio Code.
	•	Extensions: Once installed, add the Python extension for improved editing and debugging.

API Accounts and Keys

You’ll need to sign up for the following services and obtain API keys:

	1.	Alpaca: Sign up for Alpaca for trading API access.
	•	After signing up, create a paper trading account to test without risking real money.
	2.	Polygon: Sign up for Polygon to access market data.
	3.	Twilio: Sign up for Twilio to receive SMS alerts.
	4.	OpenAI (ChatGPT): Sign up for OpenAI to use ChatGPT for strategy improvement.

2. Setting Up the Project

Clone the Repository

To get the code, open a terminal and clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoTraderX.git
cd AlgoTraderX

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies:

	•	With Anaconda:

conda create -n algotraderx python=3.8
conda activate algotraderx


	•	Without Anaconda (using venv):

python -m venv algotraderx
source algotraderx/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
algotraderx\Scripts\activate     # Windows



Install Dependencies

Once inside the AlgoTraderX directory and with your environment activated, install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configuring API Keys and Parameters

Option A: Insert API Keys Directly into the Script

	1.	Open options_trading.py in your code editor.
	2.	Locate the placeholder variables (e.g., ALPACA_API_KEY, POLYGON_API_KEY).
	3.	Replace each placeholder with your actual API keys:

ALPACA_API_KEY = 'your-alpaca-api-key'
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = 'your-alpaca-secret-key'
POLYGON_API_KEY = 'your-polygon-api-key'
CHATGPT_API_KEY = 'your-openai-api-key'
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your-twilio-account-sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your-twilio-auth-token'



Option B: Store API Keys in Environment Variables (More Secure)

Alternatively, set your API keys as environment variables to avoid hardcoding them in the script.

	•	Windows:

set ALPACA_API_KEY=your-alpaca-api-key
set ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your-alpaca-secret-key
set POLYGON_API_KEY=your-polygon-api-key
set CHATGPT_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token


	•	MacOS/Linux:

export ALPACA_API_KEY=your-alpaca-api-key
export ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your-alpaca-secret-key
export POLYGON_API_KEY=your-polygon-api-key
export CHATGPT_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token



In the script, use os.environ to access these variables:

import os

ALPACA_API_KEY = os.getenv('ALPACA_API_KEY')

4. Running the Bot

	1.	Configure Trading Parameters:
	•	Set the SYMBOL variable to your desired stock (e.g., "AAPL").
	•	Customize constants such as SMA_PERIOD, RSI_PERIOD, and HIGH_VOL_PERCENT to align with your trading strategy.
	2.	Run the Bot:
Execute the bot by running:

python options_trading.py

The bot will analyze market data and execute trades based on the configured strategy.

	3.	Monitor Performance:
The bot logs each trade and calculates profit/loss, saving data to OptionsTradeHistory.json and TradePnL.json. Reviewing these files will help you refine the bot’s performance.

5. Using ChatGPT to Improve the Bot

AlgoTraderX is designed to be a starting point for algorithmic trading. You can personalize and refine it further by using ChatGPT to:

	•	Analyze Trade History: Use ChatGPT to analyze patterns in your trade logs (e.g., frequency of winning trades, most profitable times, etc.).
	•	Suggest Indicator Tweaks: Experiment with different indicator settings (like SMA or RSI periods) based on ChatGPT’s insights from trade data.
	•	Create New Strategies: Ask ChatGPT to suggest additional technical indicators, filter conditions, or even new strategies to implement.

For example, you could ask:

	“Based on this trade history data, what changes could improve my win rate?”

ChatGPT can then help you brainstorm or even generate code snippets for modifications.

6. Example Trade Execution Flow

	1.	Market Check: The bot checks if the market is open using Alpaca’s clock API.
	2.	Historical Data Fetching: It retrieves data from Polygon for analysis.
	3.	Indicator Calculation: Calculates SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and ATR for entry signals.
	4.	Trade Execution: Places trades based on data-driven conditions, using adaptive position sizing and risk-adjusted stops.
	5.	Alerts and Logs: Sends real-time SMS alerts and logs trade data, profit, and loss for review.

7. Troubleshooting and Common Issues

	•	Missing Packages: If you encounter a “module not found” error, ensure all dependencies are installed via pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	API Rate Limits: Some APIs have usage limits, so if you see rate limit errors, consider slowing down your bot or upgrading your API subscription.
	•	Environment Variable Errors: If the bot can’t find your API keys, verify the environment variables are set correctly or check that you’ve entered them directly in the script if using Option A.
