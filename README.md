1. Project Name and Overview

AlgoTraderX: Adaptive Algorithmic Trading Bot

AlgoTraderX is an advanced algorithmic trading bot built with Python, designed for the stock and options market. This bot leverages multiple APIs, including Alpaca for trading and Polygon for historical data, alongside real-time notifications via Twilio. It systematically analyzes market conditions and executes trades using well-defined technical indicators and risk management strategies.

2. Features

	•	Technical Indicator-Driven: Utilizes indicators like Simple Moving Average (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and Average True Range (ATR) for precise trade entries.
	•	Risk Management: Adaptive position sizing and dynamic stop-loss/take-profit levels based on ATR for optimal risk control.
	•	Market Regime Detection: Identifies trending vs. ranging market conditions and adjusts trade targets accordingly.
	•	Error Handling and Retry Mechanism: Implements exponential backoff for API errors to ensure reliable operation.
	•	Real-Time Alerts: Sends SMS alerts for trade execution and status updates via Twilio and provides interactive responses via ChatGPT.

3. Prerequisites

	1.	Anaconda (Optional but Recommended)
Download and install Anaconda to manage Python environments easily. Anaconda simplifies package installation and ensures compatibility.
	2.	Python 3.8 or Higher
Verify that Python is installed by running:

python --version

If it’s not installed, you can install it directly from python.org.

	3.	Python IDE or Code Editor
Recommended options:
	•	VS Code: Download here.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: If you’re using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook is already installed and can be used for code testing and experimentation.
	4.	API Keys
Obtain the following API keys and credentials:
	•	Alpaca API Key and Secret (from Alpaca)
	•	Polygon API Key (from Polygon)
	•	Twilio API SID and Auth Token (from Twilio)
	•	OpenAI API Key (from OpenAI)

4. Installation

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoTraderX.git
cd AlgoTraderX

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

If you’re using Anaconda:

conda create -n algotraderx python=3.8
conda activate algotraderx

Or, if using venv:

python -m venv algotraderx
source algotraderx/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
algotraderx\Scripts\activate     # Windows

Install Dependencies

Ensure you’re in the AlgoTraderX directory, then install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configuration

Set Up API Keys

In the script, replace placeholders with your API keys:

	•	Alpaca API: ALPACA_API_KEY and ALPACA_SECRET_KEY
	•	Polygon API: POLYGON_API_KEY
	•	Twilio API: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
	•	OpenAI ChatGPT API: CHATGPT_API_KEY

These keys are typically set in the main bot script (e.g., options_trading.py). Example:

ALPACA_API_KEY = 'your-alpaca-api-key'
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = 'your-alpaca-secret-key'
POLYGON_API_KEY = 'your-polygon-api-key'
CHATGPT_API_KEY = 'your-openai-api-key'
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your-twilio-account-sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your-twilio-auth-token'

6. Usage

Configure Trading Parameters

	•	Set the SYMBOL variable for the desired stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple).
	•	Customize other constants, like SMA_PERIOD, RSI_PERIOD, and HIGH_VOL_PERCENT, to refine the bot’s behavior and align it with your strategy.

Run the Bot

To start the trading bot:

python options_trading.py

Monitor and Refine

The bot logs each trade’s details and profit/loss data in two JSON files: OptionsTradeHistory.json and TradePnL.json. Reviewing these files regularly will help you analyze performance and make informed adjustments.

7. Example Trade Execution Flow

	1.	Market Check: Determines if the market is open using Alpaca’s clock API.
	2.	Historical Data Fetching: Retrieves past data from Polygon for analysis.
	3.	Indicator Calculation: Calculates SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and ATR for precise entry signals.
	4.	Trade Execution: Based on indicator conditions, the bot places trades with adaptive sizing and risk-adjusted stops.
	5.	Alerts and Logs: Sends real-time SMS alerts and logs trade data, profit, and loss for review.
